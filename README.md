# Running-Goblins
Hello everyone, this is a project that I finished myself, it is a game called Running Goblins.

I'm not going to say what the game is about, so I'll leave you the necessary files to try it out.

In this case, I uploaded my game to GitHub to help me publish it to all existing platforms, mainly to previous generation consoles and Chinese consoles sold on Aliexpress.

I want my game to be the next doom, that can be played on any console, it is a very simple game, with 16 very difficult levels. Please help me export or port my game to all platforms, so I will leave my source code and some files so you can try it.

The game was created in gdevelop 5 and if you help me create more games, thank you for your attention.


The game was created by the program: GDevelop 5.

with the programming language: Drag And Drop.

I don't know how to program in javascript, GDevelop 5 is a program to create games without the need for code.

Please help me port it to all platforms, mainly to retro consoles that can be hacked and upload files from USB or SD.
